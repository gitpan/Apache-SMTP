Apache-SMTP version 0.01
========================

This is a simple SMTP server/proxy written for Apache and mod_perl 2.  It 
might be a little bit dangerous, so you should probably read the pod before
you go about installing it.  Also, there is no test suite yet.  Sorry about 
that, I haven't figured out how to use Apache::Test to test 
ProcessConnectionHandler bits yet.
